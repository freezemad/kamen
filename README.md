# Kamen

A light-weight api mock engine.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'kamen'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install kamen

## Usage

You will do nothing but add some comments above your action method

```ruby
class UsersController < ApplicationController

  # MockData
  # {
  #   id: 1,
  #   name: 'Frank',
  #   gender: 'M',
  # }
  # MockData

  def show
  end
end
```

Then call the api with curl or your favourite http client like postman

```ruby
$ curl http://example.com/users/1
$ { id: 1, name: 'Frank', gender: 'M'}
```

## Development
